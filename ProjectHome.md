`ThreadKit` is a C++ library which provides simple, low-overhead, non-stack-based, cooperative multithreading for Arduino and similar microcontroller systems.  To demonstrate the library on the Arduino platform, the project includes a two-voice music-playing program called `muser`.

For more information, please see the [Minimal Guide to ThreadKit and Muser](http://threadkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/threadkit-111004-1.pdf), which is also included with the current download.
